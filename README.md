## How to Get Configuration variables:
- `midea-discover` can help you discover Midea devices from the LAN.
  ```zsh
    pip3 install msmart
    midea-discover
  ```
  - Basic Usage
  ```
  Usage: midea-discover [OPTIONS]

    Discover Midea Deivces and Get Device's info

  Options:
    -d, --debug           Enable debug logging
    -c, --amount INTEGER  Number of broadcast packets, default is 1.
                          if you have many devices, you may change this value.
    -a, --account TEXT    Your email address for your Midea account.
    -p, --password TEXT   Your password for your Midea account.
    -i, --ip TEXT         IP address of Midea device. you can use:
                          - broadcasts don't work.
                          - just get one device's info.
                          - an error occurred.
    --help                Show this message and exit.
  ```
  ***Note***: 
  - This component only supports devices with model 0xac (air conditioner) and words `supported` in the output. 
  - Configure v3 devices need `token` and `k1`.
  - You `midea-discover`  when broadcasts don't work.
  - `midea-discover` use a registered account of `MSmartHome` [[AppStore]](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/midea-home/id1254346490) [[GooglePlay]](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.midea.ai.overseas) to get Token and K1(key).
  it's my account, but now it’s an open account.
  If you just only get Token and K1(key) with this account, I and others can't get your information through this account.
  Don't use this account to login to the APP and add device, this may reveal your information. Of course, you can use your own account，this is also the way I recommend.
    ```zsh
    midea-discover -a YOUR_ACCOUNT -p YOUR_PASSWORD
    ```
